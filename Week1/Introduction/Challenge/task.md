Edit the `main` method to add several print statements to introduce yourself to your instructor.
Include any interesting or important things you would like to share.

Each statement should call the `System.out.println`
method, passing a character string in double quotes.

The program should produce
**at least** 4 lines of output.

Run your program to view the output, then press the `Check` button to confirm your code passes the test.
