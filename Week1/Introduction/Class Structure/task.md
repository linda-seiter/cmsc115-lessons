By convention, Java class names start with a capital letter. For multi-word names, capitalize the first letter of each word i.e. `PrintExample`.

- The curly braces `{` and `}` define a **block** that groups together program components.
- Each `{` must have a matching `}`.
- The `PrintExample` class block starts with ` {` on line 1 and ends with `}` on line 7.
- The `main` method block starts with ` {` on line 2 and ends with `}` on line 6.
- The statements within the `main` method block (also called the method body) are executed in order when the program runs.
- Each statement ends with a semicolon.

Run the program to confirm the output:

```text
apple
orange
pear
```
